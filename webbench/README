The CoreHttp workload provides a simple example for organizing a Faban project 
and shows you how to write a new workload. Many components are generic to most 
Faban projects. Use this as a good starting point to create your own workload. 
- See license.txt for license information.
- The 'webapp' directory contains the pages to be deployed on the server. These
  files can be used for testing.
- See the "How to Create a Workload" tutorial on testnscale.com for a 
  description of the various files and directories.

To build this workload, do the following :
- Copy build.properties.template to build.properties.
- Edit build.properties and set faban.home and faban.url.
- Type 'ant deploy.jar'

If you have Faban running on faban.url, you can then deploy as follows:
- Type 'ant deploy'

Notes:
- Workload-specific scripts and binaries should be placed into the bin directory.
- Any workload-specific libraries (for e.g JDBC library) should be placed in 
  the lib directory.
- The nbproject directory contains a Netbeans project. You can open this 
  project if you use Netbeans IDE.
